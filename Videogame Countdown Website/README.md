A website that utilizes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library to display the countdown timer of various videogaemes. At the entry of the website, the user will be asked
to enter their name. Following this, another prompt is displayed to ask the user if they like videogames. This prompt is held within a loop until the user enters the response of
"yes". This is meant as a joke considering the website is devoted to videogames. There will be a dropdown menu in the center of the screen that allows the user to choose from a list
of various videogame titles. Depending on which one they pick, an alert will be displayed on the screen that illustrates their name and tells them which videogame countdown timer 
they are going to look up. Finally, once clicking out of the alert window, the timer will be displayed.
